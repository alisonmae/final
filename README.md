<h1>Alison Mae â€¢ GA WDI4 Final Project</h1>
<h2>Pure HTML5/CSS3 (CSS Animations) </h2>
<h2> No Javascript! NO JQuery! </h2>


<h3>Animation Inspiration:</h3>

Things I Learned Along the Way:

<ul>
  <li>Working with handwriting CSS Animations can be a real pain. But the solution to that is a new cursive CSS Animation needs to be created. Bottom line, all of those animations and jQuery plugins out there are god awful.</li>
  <li>Building an entirely new CSS animation and site is possible in just a few hours, (and lots of coffee), if you want it badly enough.</li>
  <li>I am terrible about remembering to commit often while working on my own, which is hilarious to me considering how often I asked, 'Do I need to pull?' or 'Have you pushed?' during group projects in this course.</li>
  <li>Deploying static pages with Heroku takes a few extra steps (And is not found directly in their documentation!) https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks
