<h1>Alison Mae â€¢ GA WDI4 Final Project</h1>
<h2>Pure HTML5/CSS3 (CSS Animations) </h2>
<h2> No Javascript! NO JQuery! </h2>


<h3>Animation Inspiration:</h3>

<h3>Things I Learned Along the Way:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Working with handwriting CSS Animations can be a real pain. But the solution to that is a new cursive CSS Animation needs to be created. Bottom line, all of those animations and jQuery plugins out there are god awful.</li>
  <li>Building an entirely new CSS animation and site is possible in just a few hours, (and lots of coffee), if you want it badly enough.</li>
  <li>I am terrible about remembering to commit often while working on my own, which is hilarious to me considering how often I asked, 'Do I need to pull?' or 'Have you pushed?' during group projects in this course.</li>
  <li>Sketch is AWESOME. <br>https://www.sketchapp.com/</li>
  <li>Deploying static pages with Heroku takes a few extra steps (And is not found directly in their documentation!) https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks

  </ul>

<h4>Resources I utilized:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Sketch, see link above</li>
  <li>CSS Lint: Will hurt your feelings*
<br>(And help you code better)
<br>http://csslint.net/</li>
  <li>FontAwesome for social/footer icons <br> https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/</li>
  <li>Web Designer Depot, mainly for quick CSS reference, <br> http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/</li>
  <li>Google Fonts  <br> https://www.google.com/fonts</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Some things I could have done differently</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Better communication: I should have voiced my paralyzed state early on, and utilized my instructors, not been so stubborn.</li>
  <li>Spent a little more time wireframing every exactly before trying to tackle so many graphics</li>
  <li>Responsive site - could have been pretty simple if I had prioritized my time efficiently</li>
  <li>Drank more coffee, maybe perhaps finally tried a Red Bull</li>

<h4>Things I Would Like to Add:<h4>

<ul>
  <li>Lightbox 'About Me' section</li>
  <li>Writing portfolio, with CSS Handwriting animation</li>
  <li>Full screen video resume, with pdf download of resume</li>
  <li>Photo + Video Portfolio, with grid view and lightboxes<li>
  <li>As stated above, make responsive, my own grid system</li>
  <li>More CSS Animations within site to make it that much more interactive</li>
</ul>
